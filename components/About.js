            Hurn Recycling was established in 1998 by the now owner Mr Peri Cascarino. Peri’s background in the waste paper recycling sector began with Sevenside (now St Regis) Waste Paper. He started working within the Company at the Company’s Hurn site in Christchurch. He rapidly rose through the ranks and ultimately took the role of general manger, obtained his O-licence in 5 years.

            <p className="lead mb-4 pb-1">
            Unfortunately due to a national decline in recycled material markets the site at Hurn was closed however Peri took over the site and founded Hurn Recycling Ltd.

            <p className="lead mb-4 pb-1">
            We are proud to say that we are now the largest independent waste company in the County of Dorset, and offer our waste collection services and brokerage in the four surrounding Counties.
            </p>
            <p className="lead mb-4 pb-1">
            This success is due to our effective motivated team inspired by Peri, and our keen interest in the use of the latest technologies to deliver a level of service that is second to none.
