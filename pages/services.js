          Hurn Recycling knows that every business is unique. A holiday park
          needing a weekly glass and general waste collection isnâ€™t going to
          need to dispose of electrical equipment to the WEEE Legislation
          requirements every week as well. However they may need that service
          when they refurbish the kitchen or leisure facilities. A school
          produces masses of waste paper on a weekly basis, but will only need
          their fluorescent bulbs taken and degassed once every term.
