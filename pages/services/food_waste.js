              Segregating your food waste into recycling bins helps  reduce the weight in your <Link href="/services/general_waste" ><a className="highlight-link">general waste bins</a></Link> and is a great way to protect the environment as all food waste is turned into compost.

        <p className="lead">The UK is a global leader in tackling food waste, with the government pledging to reduce food waste by 20% by 2025, total food waste levels falling by 480,000 tonnes between 2015 and 2018 and the Environment Bill committing to eliminating food waste from landfill by 2030.</p>
        <p className="lead">The UK government has confirmed that the new legislation will introduce a clear set of recyclable materials for both household and commercial waste, including the separation of dry and organic waste collections.</p>
        <p className="lead">It is likely that companies producing over a set threshold of food waste will be required to recycle it, similar to the legislation currently in place in Scotland and that fines will be served to those who donâ€™t comply.</p>
