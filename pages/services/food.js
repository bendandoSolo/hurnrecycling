              All food waste is 100% recycled via a local bio plant in the county, we provide 240-litre bins, these are tipped and then a new bin liner and then sanitised spray added to freshen the bin.

              Segregating your food waste will help you to reduce the weight in your general waste bins and a great way to improve the environment as it is turned into compost.

        <p className="lead">The UK is a global leader in tackling food waste, with the government pledging to reduce food waste by 20% by 2025, total food waste levels falling by 480,000 tonnes between 2015 and 2018 and the Environment Bill committing to eliminating food waste from landfill by 2030.</p>
        <p className="lead">The UK government has confirmed that the new legislation will introduce a clear set of recyclable materials for both household and commercial waste, including the separation of dry and organic waste collections.</p>
        <p className="lead">It is likely that companies producing over a set threshold of food waste will be required to recycle it, similar to the legislation currently in place in Scotland and that fines will be served to those who donâ€™t comply.</p>
