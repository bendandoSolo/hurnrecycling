                We ensure that your business plays a part in reducing the amount
                of paper getting to Dorsetâ€™s landfills. We provide containers to
                be placed in useful locations around the office i.e. beside
                photocopiers and printers which, when full, can be stored
                awaiting collection. Should storage be a problem we can arrange
                on site storage containers.

                We can recover almost every type of waste paper including white
                based paper like letters, photocopies, computer printouts. Even
                general office papers are no problem like magazines, coloured
                paper, newspapers and envelopes. All this can be used in
                conjunction with our confidential destruction service.
